                Unlawful presence is time spent in the US after your authorised stay expired — the
                date on your I-94, not your visa stamp. Once you hit 180 days and leave, bans apply.

              <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                No. The 3-year or 10-year ban only activates when you leave and try to re-enter. But
                unlawful presence keeps accumulating every day you stay.

                It&apos;s automatically voided — even after one day. You cannot use that visa to re-enter
                the US. You&apos;d need to apply for a new visa from your home country.

              <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                Yes — if you filed a timely extension (Form I-539) before your I-94 expired, the
                unlawful presence clock is paused while it&apos;s pending. If denied, the clock starts
